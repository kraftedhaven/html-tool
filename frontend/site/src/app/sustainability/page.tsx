            <p>The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters globally. Every year, millions of tons of clothing end up in landfills â€” many of them synthetic and unable to decompose. This mountain of waste leaches toxic chemicals into our soil and water. Fast fashion has created a culture of disposability, where clothes are worn a few times and then thrown away.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Carbon Footprint</h3>
            <p>From growing cotton to manufacturing, shipping, and washing clothes, the industry has a massive carbon footprint, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. The energy-intensive processes and global supply chains create a cycle of environmental damage that is unsustainable for our planet.</p>

        <p className="mb-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center">
          At Hidden Haven Threads (HHT) and our creative partner, The Krafted Haven (TKH), our entire business model is a response to this crisis. We don't just sell clothes; we practice a philosophy of radical reuse and conscious creation.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. We Revive & Rework</h3>
            <p>Every piece in our collection is vintage or pre-loved. By giving existing garments a new life, we directly divert clothing from landfills and reduce the demand for new production. Our custom, reworked pieces turn forgotten fabrics into unique works of art.</p>

          <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. We Choose Conscious Materials</h3>
            <p>When we add to our pieces, we prioritize sustainable and natural materials. We avoid virgin plastics and synthetics, opting for biodegradable threads, eco-friendly paints, and natural dyes where possible. This minimizes our chemical footprint.</p>

          <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. We Empower with Tools</h3>
            <p>Through The Krafted Haven, we develop tools that empower other sellers to participate in the circular economy. By making it easier to list and sell pre-owned goods, we help grow the sustainable fashion ecosystem from the ground up.</p>
